I declaire in public that this is sololy a tryout by Bento R.G. also known as Tex W. the 14 year old creator of a couple games in web sites using HTML, CSS and Java Script.
I would also like to say that he also knows very clearly how to wright code in SQL, but not how to practicly use it in the formal ways.
Bento has been learning since November of 2024 how to program with Khan Academy, so he not exactly knows how to code entirely, not just quite yet.
That would be all...
